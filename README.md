## How many ways are there to place the ships in a standard battleship game? ##
I started this project in my strong language Oracle PL/SQL; but then thought since I hadn't planned to use SQL at all for this project, PL/SQL doesn't have any particular advantage in this case.  So this might be a good time to improve my python skills!

# small case #
How many ways are there to place 2 1x3 ships and a 1x2 ship in a 4x4 board?
Some hand calculation tells me there should be 1500 or so.  Thats a small enough number to use as a proof of concept.
